But she missed the spot where she held him by his heel. And that spot was where he remained mortal whereas he would be rendered invulnerable everywhere else on his body. Having been trained by Philoctetes, Achilles would become Phil's prized pupil but things would end after Achilles ended up injured due to his heel, losing his fame and hero career. The trainer of heroes was there in his success and failure, but still kept a statue of the would-be hero on his island.",
